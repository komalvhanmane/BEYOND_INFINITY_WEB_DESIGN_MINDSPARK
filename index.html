                    <h3 class="centre">Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called “radioactivity”), Marie decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter. She discovered that this was true for thorium at the same time as Gerhard Carl Schmidt did. Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende. Pitchblende, a mineral whose activity is superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre then joined Marie in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. Pierre devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations. In 1902 Marie succeeded in isolating one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride that was entirely free from barium. Scientists soon recognized the importance of this work. In 1903 Marie , Pierre, and Becquerel shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. Marie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in any subject. Pure radium alone was not isolated until 1910 by Marie with the help of chemist André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre’s pupils. The radioactivity of pure radium proved to be more than one million times as great as that of either uranium or thorium. In 1911 Marie was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for the isolation of pure radium.</h3>
